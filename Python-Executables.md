### Summary

- **py2exe**: Best for Windows-only applications and relatively simple projects.
- **PyInstaller**: Best for cross-platform applications with moderate complexity; easy to use with a wide range of options and good dependency handling.
- **cx_Freeze**: Flexible but requires a `setup.py` configuration; good for applications where you want more control over the build process.
- **Nuitka**: Ideal for performance-critical applications and when code security (through compilation) is a priority. Nuitka generates optimized machine code but is more complex to configure.

For most projects that require quick and cross-platform deployment, **PyInstaller** is often the preferred tool. **Nuitka** is recommended for cases where performance is critical.
